# Work Day Scheduler

## Description
The motivation behind this project was to further my understanding of Javascript APIs. In this project, I used dayjs and jQUERY to dynamically update the date, time block color codes, and local storage interaction. The application itself is a daily scheduler from 9AM - 5PM.

## Usage
The UI of this project is simple. Upon loading, the user is presented with a series of time blocks from 9AM - 5PM. If the time block is in the past, the background color will be gray. If it is currently within the hour of the time block, the background color is red. If the time block hasn't happened yet, it will remain green. Each time block contains a text box where the user can enter a task that needs to be done. Once the text is entered, select the save button located on the right side of the time block to save your work. After hitting save, the time block information is saved in local storage to be automatically loaded when the user returns to the website.
